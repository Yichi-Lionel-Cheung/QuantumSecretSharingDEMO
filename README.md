# QuantumSecretSharingDEMO
This is a python demo of quantum secret sharing protocol. The demo based on Qiskit.

## Basic Concept

Alice wants to split her secret into $n$ shares and send to $n$ others. Only when $k (\frac{n}{2}< k \le n)$ or more shares work together can recover the secret. We call the scheme is ((k,n)) secret sharing.
